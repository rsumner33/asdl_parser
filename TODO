* Update asdl_c.py... can be done separately

Modernization of asdl_c.py:

* s/getopt/argparse/
* INC_DIR/SRC_DIR globals to communicate stuff into main() - meh
* Get rid of XXXs - at this point we can assume they're resolved
* Remove limitation of not being able to produce both C and H simultaneously
* Node-speficic hacks in reflow_lines??

Makefiles:

* Why run asdl_c twice / parse the ASDL twice? - because makefile rules want
  to have a single target.
